Hello,

We are two students (Alexandre HUANG and Kevin KAMALANATHAN) in Master 2 MASERATI course Data Science, and we wish to carry out a project of end of study consisting in creating initially a package which will make it possible to "translate" code written in SAS language into Python code, then in a second time to integrate it in a dynamic interface which will display on the left the SAS code which one wants to translate and on the right the result in Python code.

For example, we want to translate the following SAS code into Python:
PROC MEANS DATA = Table ;
RUN ;

The interface would give us the following result:
Table.describe()

We are currently in the construction phase of our project, and in addition to being rewarding for us, it could be useful to all SAS and Python users. Indeed, this project is very important to us because our first steps in programming were made on SAS and when we started to learn Python we had no reference because these two languages are very different. This is why we embarked on this project under the guidance of our dissertation tutor Mr Bargain.
